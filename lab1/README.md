LAB1: Case Study – Unity

1.	What are the company's motivators of migration to the cloud?

-	The primary reason for migrating is to stay updated with cloud infrastructure and to better meet the game developer’s needs. Also, they needed a platform that would help developers find answers quickly.
-	The second reason they chose Azure for their cloud is because they have a partnership with Microsoft. Also, “Unity (title) enables to get more users across platforms like windows and Xbox.
-	Unity also used services like Microsoft Azure OpenAI so that they built a platform called as “Muse Chat” that performs like a chatbot – answers questions and provide coding solutions.

2.	What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?

-	What were the major challenges while migrating to cloud infrastructure (before cloud).
-	I know the fact they have partnership with Microsoft, but Did they prefer AWS for migrating at least few of their services.
-	I know clouds are generally “Security-safe” but did they have any additional security measures and considerations that they need to take care of?

4.	A phased migration approach is the most suitable for the company's transition to the cloud. This method allows for incremental migration of components or functionalities, aligning with the company's use of Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to build Muse Chat, an AI assistant for coding solutions. The company's focus on integrating AI into development and game development processes suggests that specific workloads were prioritized for migration. A phased approach supports the need for reliability, quick answers, and comprehensive support, ensuring each phase is tested and optimized, minimizing disruption while benefiting from cloud infrastructure in key business areas.

5.	Planning :Set objectives, assess infrastructure, and form a migration team.
Cloud Setup : Choose cloud services (e.g., Azure), set up infrastructure, and define security.
Data Migration & Testing : Migrate data, test applications, and resolve issues.
Deployment & Optimization : Deploy workloads, optimize performance, and implement backup solutions.
Training & Transition: Train teams, transition support, and review the migration.

7.	First main reason is that I love unity. Moreover I feel that:-
-	Incorporating features like Azure AI Content Safety to ensure responsible and secure use of AI technology.
-	Ensuring that Azure’s services can handle large-scale projects and demands, supporting both indie and major game studios.
-	Ensuring that the AI assistant, Muse Chat, provides answers specifically tailored to developers' issues within their projects.
