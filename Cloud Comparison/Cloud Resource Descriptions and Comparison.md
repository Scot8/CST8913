# Purpose of this Task

The purpose of this is to compare cloud services across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. By exploring equivalent services, we can understand how each provider names and structures their offerings, and identify any unique features they may have. This will help me make better decisions when working with different cloud platforms.

# Introduction

A vast range of services are provided by cloud service providers like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to satisfy the networking, computation, and storage requirements of contemporary applications.  
Even though their services frequently perform comparable functions, each provider is distinguished from the others by differences in features, capabilities, and naming standards.  
Key similarities and differences between equivalent services from the three cloud providers.

## Example 1: AWS EC2 vs. Azure Virtual Machines vs. Google Compute Engine (Compute Services)

**Similarity:** All of them provide scalable processing power for virtual machine operations, and with these services, you may set resource allocation, select instance kinds, and scale in response to demand.

**Differences:**  
- With a variety of instance types and granular pricing methods (on-demand, reserved, and spot instances), EC2 is renowned for its versatility.  
- Businesses that use Windows Server and other Microsoft products choose Azure Virtual Machines because of their strong integration with the Microsoft ecosystem.  
- Google Compute Engine prioritizes simplicity, including robust connectivity with Google's data services, and automatic savings for continuous consumption.

## Unique Features or Capabilities that Certain Services May Offer Compared to Their Counterparts

### Example 2: AWS Lambda vs. Azure Functions vs. Google Cloud Functions (Serverless Computing)

- **AWS Lambda:** It guarantees that features don't require cold starts and offers an extensive network of event-driven connections with additional AWS services.  
- **Azure Functions:** Stands out for its durable functions, which allow stateful workflows for long-running processes, making it easier to manage complicated state management and retries in serverless apps.  
- **Google Cloud Functions:** They are simple and effective for real-time event-driven architecture. Google's focus on tight integration with Firebase makes it perfect for mobile app backends and real-time updates.

## Naming Conventions Between Cloud Providers

### Example 3: RDS vs. CosmosDB/SQL Database vs. Google Cloud (Database Services)

- **AWS:** Relational Database Service (RDS) states precisely what it does actually. It offers relational database capabilities as a managed service.  
- **Azure SQL Database and Cosmos DB (for NoSQL):** They highlight the database technologies that underpin the services.  
- **Google Cloud:** Cloud SQL and Firestore: They have shorter and more user-friendly names, focusing on simplicity of use and connection into Google's larger data platform.
